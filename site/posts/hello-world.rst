`Grauwoelfchen's Canvas` is back ;)

I used to post articles about something which I learned, into the blog.
But it had been gone, because I had to move sometimes for work, and I was busy
to maintain servers besides my own one.
Now, I've been just created it as GitLab pages. It's super easy!

So, I'll post back old articles here, gradually.

Previous version had been built on an application using Ruby + MongoDB,
as Markdown format.
This site is built as static website using Python.
(as `reStructured Text`_ format)

I liked to learn something through building and renew (or breaking) the blog.

Let's start, again!
